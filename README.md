07.07 - Slight glitch that I'm in the process of working on. For some reason, when you create a new project your first attempt to add a character will not work. To get around this for now, after creating a new project select the menu, select load project, and reload your project from the list.

07.12 - The above glitch has been fixed and is currently pending in the app store. Upcoming version will have a more fluid way to remove the keyboard, a recently discovered crash, as well as fix a text overlay problem you may or may not have encountered.
